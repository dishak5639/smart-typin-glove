Enhancing Tactile Ability Inâ€¨Patients Exhibiting Cerebrovascular Disorder Using a smart-typing glove.
    Hemiparesis and Transient Ischemic attack (TIA also known as mini stroke) significantly impact motor skills, particularly the pollex-digit opposition movement, which is crucial for daily activities. This analysis explores the development of a smart typing glove designed to assess and enhance tactile abilities in these patients. The glove is embedded with tactile sensors sewn and integrated with symbols on finger phalanges, interfaced directly to Raspberry Pi. The system is designed and developed to convert typing to text, provide a game interface, display performance graphs, log timestamps, vital parameters like pulse rate, blood pressure etc and store patient data. The effectiveness of the device will be evaluated through a fifteen-day trial with ten dextral patients and compare their motor skills with normal people, aiming to promote rehabilitation and independence.
